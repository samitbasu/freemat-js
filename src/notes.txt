//  Look at the logic around white space -
// Inside a bracket expression
// We change the rules to maximize the chance of correct parsing.
// Binary operators that can only be binary operators swallow whitespace
// on both sides.
// Operators that could be unary or binary ("+" and "-") first try the
// unary operators, and then the binary ones.
// So first, we need to know if we are inside a comma delimited square
// bracket expression
